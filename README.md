# libPietVM
###### a virtual machine for [Piet][piet-origin] encoded images

### What is Piet?

[Piet][piet-origin] is an esoteric programming language designed by David Morgan-Mar. Its peculiarity is the lack of readability as well as the way the source code is stored.

Images. Images are the source code. The colors in the source images are the keywords found in any other programming language. And the arrangement of the pixels is the order of events in the code.

### What is libPietVM then?

libPietVM makes it possible to analyze and execute Piet *encoded* images. And one can easily embed this.
Check out the milestones to see the realized and planned features.
